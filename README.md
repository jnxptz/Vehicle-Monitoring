# 🚘 Board Members Vehicle Monitoring System

## Executive Summary
The **Board Members Vehicle Monitoring System (BMVMS)** is an enterprise-grade information system designed to monitor, manage, and analyze the utilization of official vehicles assigned to board members and executive officials. The system centralizes vehicle data, trip activity, and administrative oversight to ensure accountability, operational efficiency, and data-driven decision-making.

This solution is suitable for **government agencies, academic institutions, and corporate organizations** that manage a fleet of official service vehicles.

## Problem Statement
Organizations that manage executive vehicles often rely on manual logbooks or fragmented monitoring methods. These approaches commonly result in:
- Limited visibility of vehicle usage  
- Inefficient tracking of assignments and trips  
- Weak accountability mechanisms  
- Delayed and inaccurate reporting  

The **BMVMS** addresses these challenges by providing a **secure, centralized, and auditable vehicle monitoring platform**.
